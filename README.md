# Analysis of Crime rate in San Francisco
This project is about crime rate in city of San Francisco. I am going to analyze the dataset taken from Kaggle.com 
(link: https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/sanfranciso-crime-dataset)

To realise analysis I am using Jupyter Notebook. The programming language is Python 3.
For my analysis I decided to use such variables:
+ Category
+ Description 
+ Day of week 
+ Date 
+ Time 
+ Disctrict 
+ Resolution 
+ Address 
+ X 
+ Y 
+ Location 

More detailed information you can found in the attached files.

It is important to mention that in creating map I have used library Folium which is not supported in Git platform. I have tried to import notebook as HTML file, but it does not work. The map is still invisible in git. That is why here is ipynb file as the final version.
