# Analysis of Crime rate in San Francisco
This project is about crime rate in city of San Francisco. I am going to analyze the dataset taken from Kaggle.com 
(link: https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/sanfranciso-crime-dataset)

To realise analysis I am using Jupyter Notebook. The programming language is Python 3.
For my analysis I decided to use such variables:
+ Category
+ Description 
+ Day of week 
+ Date 
+ Time 
+ Disctrict 
+ Resolution 
+ Address 
+ X 
+ Y 
+ Location 

More detailed information you can found in the attached files
